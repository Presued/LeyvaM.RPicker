Peer Review By: Kenneth Fujimura -- Everything works the way it should! All the data validation does their thing correctly. The code is easy to follow and pretty clean. I liked that you imbued some personality into the responses, it made testing a lot of fun. I've got little to no constructive feedback here, the only thing I noticed is that on line 66, your if statement checks to see if it says "Yes" instead of what I assume you want "YES". So even if you plug in "YES" the program fails that check and prints the fail state. But it doesn't really hold the program either so it's not a big deal.
